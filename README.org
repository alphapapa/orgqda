* orgqda: Qualitative Data Analysis for Emacs org-mode addicts

~orgqda~ defines a minor mode and several commands for making [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_%2528social_sciences%2529#Qualitative_approach][coding]] and collection of coded snippets possible in text written in org-mode. I created it for coding field notes and interview transcripts in my PhD project.

It works in a simple (and perhaps stupid) way by viewing org-mode tags added to degenerate inlinetasks as applying to the preceding paragraph. Like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Some text that should be given some codes. We make this text reasonably long so that it appears to be some kind of paragraph and not only a few sentences. This is a third sentence. And this a fourth.
*************** âˆˆ :stupidSentences:anotherCode:
#+END_EXAMPLE

Additionally, when tags are applied to ordinary headings or inlinetasks with content, the subtree or inlinetask is extracted instead of the preceding paragraph.

"Codes" can be listed with ~orgqda-list-tags~ and all regions for a specific code extracted with ~orgqda-collect-tagged~ (or by clicking on a tag or =C-c C-o= on it). Both these functions creates a custom org-mode buffer with links to the original regions.

Codes can also be renamed with ~orgqda-rename-tags~ and merged via drag and drop in the code-listing buffer created by ~orgqda-list-tags~. These operations find and replace tags across all files defined in ~orgqda-tag-files~, so undoing can be messy, make sure to use version control.

** Minor mode
It defines a minor mode ~orgqda-mode~ which, when enabled, gathers tags for listing and completion from all files defined via ~orgqda-tag-files~. This is helpful for instance when keeping different field journals and transcripts in different files but still using a common coding scheme for all of them.

** csv-export of coded regions
I have been using the concept mapping software [[http://vue.tufts.edu/][VUE]] for sorting through coded regions graphically. The csv-export functions is a way of importing regions into VUE, or other programs.
The csv-export code is currently not so generalized and may be changed.
